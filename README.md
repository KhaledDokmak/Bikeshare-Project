# Bikeshare-Project
My Udacity project that I have made to improve my skills in pandas for a nano-degree Udacity program. Please don't use it to copy the project.
# overview
## Introduction
This Python script is written for Project 1 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Dataset
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of DAND.

## The Requirements
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

## 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
>* most common month
>* most common day of week
>* mos1t common hour of day
## 2 Popular stations and trip
>* most common start station
>* most common end station
>* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
## 3 Trip duration
>* total travel time
>* average travel time
## 4 User info
>* counts of each user type
>* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
>* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
